# Blockchain Learning Repository

Welcome to the Blockchain Learning Repository! This repository contains code and documentation related to the tasks assigned by the Kharagpur Blockchain Society.

## Task 1: Research Report

### Price Sensitivity of Bitcoin using Technical Parameters of Trading

In this report, we explore the price sensitivity of Bitcoin by analyzing various technical parameters of trading, such as Bollinger Bands, SMA (Simple Moving Average), and moving averages. We delve into how these indicators can provide insights into Bitcoin's price movements and how traders can use them to make informed decisions.

## Task 2: Fund-Me Contract Modifications

In Task 2, we were tasked with modifying the Fund-Me contract provided in the course material. The following modifications were made:

### a: Ensure Unique Addresses in the Funders Array

We ensured that the Funders array only contains unique addresses to prevent the inclusion of duplicate addresses, enhancing the integrity of the contract.

### b: Transfer Ownership Functionality

We implemented the transfer ownership functionality, allowing the contract deployer to transfer ownership rights to another address.

### c: Removal of Chain-Link Integration

We removed the Chain-Link integration from the Fund-Me contract to simplify its implementation and focus primarily on handling funders' contributions and ownership functionality.

## How to Use

To use the Fund-Me contract and explore the modifications, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anuragsingh132200/blockchain-learning.git`
2. Navigate to the Fund-Me directory: `cd blockchain-learning`
3. Compile and deploy the contract using your preferred Ethereum development environment.
